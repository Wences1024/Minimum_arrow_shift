You are given a string S representing a sequence of N arrows. Each arrow in the sequence points in one of the four directions: up("^"), down("v"), lef("<") or right(">"). In one move, you can rotate an arrow as shown in the image below:

^ ----- <
> ----- ^
v ------ >
< ------ v


Write a function:
def solution(S)

that, given a string S of length N denoting the directions of the arrows, returns the minimum number of moves required to make all of the arrows point in the same direction.

Example: For S ="vv>>vv" the function should return 4. It is optimal to rotate arrows so that all of the point right


Asume that:

- N is an integer within the range [1..100]
string S is made only the following characters: '<','^','>' and/or 'v'

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus on the assessment
